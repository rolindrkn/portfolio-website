		<h1> Hello. I'm Rosalind, a life long learner, currently in software development. </h1>

		<h2> How did I get here? </h2>
		<div>
			<p>I was a very curious kid growing up. I loved opening up wrist watches or box radios to see how things ticked. I may not have restored the items complete with all the screws but I was fascinated how things worked. I never knew this was what I wanted to do until later in life. Being a girl, this was not the acceptable Asian career path as I was encouraged to become a Doctor or Lawyer. I just knew I was mechanically inclined.</p>

			<p><u>My Best Friend</u></p>
			
			<p>Around 2013, my best friend Curious (my cat) died of Feline Leukemia. I wanted to learn what happened and wondered if I could have done something to save her.  With this determination, I changed my major to Animal Science. </p>

			<p><u>Animal Science</u></p>

			<p>About a year later, I was going through the motions of waking up, going to university class and biding my time to graduate. My life wasn’t very interesting.  However, my direction in life changed once I worked on my Capstone Project and wrote my Thesis paper.  After an exhaustive search, I finally found a Professor willing to work with me (the girl who was just complacent to be there). Surprisingly, I enjoyed researching and writing the paper. I learned so much about Animal Science writing my paper than I did in my whole University career.</p>

			<p>That was it!!!! I wanted to be a researcher. Next step was to do a Masters degree.  It was rewarding producing questions and answering them through research. Unfortunately, I was not able to get enter the Masters degree program so I applied for a related job in my field.</p>

			<p><u>Startup company</u></p>

			<p>I was lucky enough to learn about a startup company working on a topic in my Thesis manuscript. Eager to be part of their team, I applied for the “Technician” position.  However, the job was in British Colombia and I just completed my degree in Saskatchewan. Luckily, I was offered the position and I packed up all my belongings and headed to BC for my new career.</p>

			<p>When I started the Technician job, I learned that I was a Production Technician. “What was I supposed to do?”  I had blindly taken a job without knowing what it entailed. I just had to make the best of the situation as a lab position will surely come up one day. I was wrong, but staying was the best decision I made.</p>

			<p>Being with the company, I learned many skills and I learned specifically what I liked and disliked in a job.  I excelled in:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>machine operations</li>
				<li>troubleshooting</li>
				<li>production optimiaztion</li>
			</ul>

			<p>By my 3rd month, I was promoted to Assistant Lead Hand. What I loved most about the job was the learning and mastering the job processes.  I also started helping out in other department and this kept me going to work everyday.  When machinery stopped working, I stayed with the maintenance team to learn and study how they resolved the issue.  With my supervisor’s permission, I found how to optimize processes and spent more time learning.</p>

			<p>Eventually, my learning plateaued and it was harder for me to wake up for work. So I started asking myself. “What am I doing this for?”  I wanted to do more. So I came up with two options.  I could stay with the company and move up or I could go back to school and study technology since this is what I feel is my best fit.</p>

			<p>I chose the latter. Which brings me here. Do I regret my choice? Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I didn’t switch fields.  But then I wouldn’t have learned about the IT field. I don’t know if anyone would ever be certain where they are going or what they want to do, but if you don’t try it, you will never know.</p>

			<p>Thank you for reading about my journey, I wish you luck with yours.</p>
