		<h1> Hello. I'm Rosalind, a life long learner, currently in software development. </h1>

		<h2> How did I get here? </h2>

		<p>I remember growing up a curious kid. I loved opening watches or box radios to see how things worked, although not fully understanding what was going on and placing things back with an extra screw or two not used. Unfortunately, I never really knew this was what I liked until later in life. Being a girl, it wasn't something I was encourage to do and like most Asians, a doctor was a respectful career choice.</p>

		<p>Fast forward to 2013, my best friend, Curious, died of Feline Lukemia. Instead of using the internet, I decided to study animal science, to learn what had happened and if there was anything I could have done. Let's just say, sometimes it's better to just ask google.</p>

		<p>After my grief for Curious passed(a year later), I went through the motions of waking up, going to class, just so I could graduate. Part of our capstone project was to write a thesis paper, and I reluctantly found a profesor that was willing to work with me, the girl who was just present to be present. Suprisingly, I enjoyed researching and writing the paper, I learned more than I ever did in one year than my whole University career.</p>

		<p>That was <b>IT</b>! I wanted to be a researcher, I wanted to do a masters. It was rewarding to having questions and answering those questions through research. Unfortunately, my grades were so low, no professor wanted to take a chance on me. Fine, I thought, I deserved it. So I started applying for jobs.</p>

		<p>I was lucky enough to learn about a startup that was doing work on one of the topic I wrote about in my thesis manuscript. Eager to be part of their team, I applied for the "technician" job. Since the job was in British Columbia, and I just compelted my degree in Saskatchewan, I did my interview over the phone. I packed up all my belongings and headed to BC the week after.</p>

		<p>When I started the job, I learned that I was a production technician. What was I suppose to do? I had blindly taken a job not knowing what it entailed. Fine, since I'm here, I'll make the best of it, a lab position is sure to come up oe day, I thought. I was wrong, but staying was the best decision I made.</p>

		<p>Being with the company, I learned many skills and I learned more about what I liked and disliked. I learned that I excelled in machine operations, troubleshooting, production optimization. By my 3rd month, I was promoted to asssistant lead hand. What I loved most about the job was the <b>learning</b>, after mastering my department, I started helping out in other departments, that kept me going to work everyday. When machinary stopped working, I even stayed with the maintanance team to learn a little about basic machinery repair, and they were happy to teach. With the permission of my supervisors, I found ways to optimize the current process.</p>

		<p>Eventually the time came when I stopped learning, it started becoming harder for me to wake up for work. So I started asking "what am I doing this for?" I wanted to do more. So I came up with 2 options, I could stay with the company and move up, or, I could go back to school to bring up my grades, maybe take courses in technology since it seemed like I fit the role.</p>

		<p>I chose the latter. Which brings me here. Do I regret my choice? Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I didn't switch fields. But then I wouldn't have learn about IT. I don't know if anyone will ever be certain where they're going or what they want to do, but if you don't try it, you would never know.</p>
